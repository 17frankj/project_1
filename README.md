Eric Hart: In my program, I take the user's name and age, and then I return what their age would be if they were 3 years older. In order to use this program, one must open the .ipynb file in an environment such as JupyterLab. Using the program is as easy as following the prompts given in the console. In order to contribute to this program, you can fork the original repository and then make your changes, and then push these changes as a pull request.

Kai Wisniewski: This is a simple interactive user code asking for the user's input name and their favorite color. When the user inputs both answers, the code prints out a personalized message: "Hell," "My name is," and "My favorite color is"
